            "objective": "# WildFly Flyway Subsystem - Production Ready Development\n\n## Project Context\nWe have a WildFly Flyway subsystem (similar to the existing Liquibase subsystem) that needs to be made production-ready. The subsystem integrates Flyway into WildFly 28 with Spring Boot-style configuration.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Basic subsystem structure exists and builds successfully\n- Core functionality implemented: Spring Boot property resolver, deployment processor, migration service\n- Tests compile but integration tests need WildFly server setup\n- Feature pack module temporarily disabled due to dependency issues\n- Located at: /home/torsten/projects-akdb/wildfly-liquibase/wildfly-flyway\n\n## Mission: Make Production Ready\n\n### 1. Code Quality & Testing (Priority: CRITICAL)\n- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage for all core components\n- [ ] Fix and enable all integration tests with proper WildFly server setup\n- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for SpringBootPropertyResolver\n- [ ] Implement error handling and edge case tests\n- [ ] Add performance tests for large migration sets\n- [ ] Verify thread safety of all components\n\n### 2. Feature Completeness (Priority: HIGH)\n- [ ] Complete feature pack build configuration\n- [ ] Add support for all Flyway configuration properties\n- [ ] Implement migration callbacks and hooks\n- [ ] Add JMX monitoring capabilities\n- [ ] Support for multiple datasources\n- [ ] Implement migration rollback functionality\n- [ ] Add migration validation and repair commands\n\n### 3. Security & Compliance (Priority: CRITICAL)\n- [ ] Security audit of property resolution (prevent injection attacks)\n- [ ] Secure handling of database credentials\n- [ ] Add role-based access control for migration operations\n- [ ] Implement audit logging for all migration activities\n- [ ] Validate SQL migrations for security vulnerabilities\n- [ ] Add encryption support for sensitive configurations\n\n### 4. Operations & Monitoring (Priority: HIGH)\n- [ ] Comprehensive logging with appropriate levels\n- [ ] Health check endpoints for migration status\n- [ ] Metrics collection (migration time, success/failure rates)\n- [ ] Integration with WildFly management console\n- [ ] CLI commands for migration management\n- [ ] Migration history viewing and reporting\n\n### 5. Documentation (Priority: HIGH)\n- [ ] Complete README with installation and configuration guide\n- [ ] API documentation for all public interfaces\n- [ ] Migration guide from Liquibase to Flyway\n- [ ] Troubleshooting guide with common issues\n- [ ] Performance tuning guide\n- [ ] Example applications and migration scripts\n\n### 6. Build & Release (Priority: MEDIUM)\n- [ ] Fix Galleon feature pack configuration\n- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] Configure SonarQube for code quality\n- [ ] Maven Central release configuration\n- [ ] Docker image with pre-configured WildFly+Flyway\n- [ ] Version compatibility matrix documentation\n\n### 7. Integration Testing (Priority: HIGH)\n- [ ] Test with different databases (H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)\n- [ ] Verify Spring Boot property compatibility\n- [ ] Test vendor-specific migration paths\n- [ ] Cluster deployment testing\n- [ ] Domain mode testing\n- [ ] Hot deployment/redeployment scenarios\n\n### 8. Performance Optimization (Priority: MEDIUM)\n- [ ] Optimize migration scanning for large codebases\n- [ ] Connection pool integration and optimization\n- [ ] Lazy loading of migration resources\n- [ ] Caching of migration metadata\n- [ ] Parallel migration execution support\n- [ ] Memory usage optimization\n\n## Technical Constraints\n- MUST maintain WildFly 28 compatibility\n- NO CDI integration (use MSC services only)\n- MUST support Spring Boot property format (spring.flyway.*)\n- MUST follow WildFly subsystem best practices\n- MUST be compatible with Jakarta EE 10\n\n## Quality Gates\n- All tests must pass\n- Code coverage > 80%\n- No critical security vulnerabilities\n- Documentation complete and reviewed\n- Performance benchmarks meet targets\n- Successfully deployed in production-like environment\n\n## Expected Deliverables\n1. Production-ready codebase with all features implemented\n2. Comprehensive test suite with CI/CD integration\n3. Complete documentation package\n4. Release artifacts ready for Maven Central\n5. Docker images and deployment examples\n6. Performance benchmark results\n\nPlease develop this project to production standards, ensuring enterprise-grade quality, security, and reliability. Focus on robustness, maintainability, and operational excellence.",
